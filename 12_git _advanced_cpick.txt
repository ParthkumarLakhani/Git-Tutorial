# Cherry-Picking and Bisect

🌿 Git Cherry-pick

What is git cherry-pick ??
git cherry-pick takes a specific commit from another branch and applies it to your current branch.
👉 Think of it as: “I want this one commit only, not the whole branch.”

git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

Example
git cherry-pick abc123

This:
  Copies commit abc123
  Applies it on top of your current branch
  Creates a new commit with the same changes (different hash)


When to Use Cherry-pick

✅ Hotfix from another branch
✅ Bring a single bug fix into main
✅ Avoid merging entire feature branch



Real-world Scenario
main
  |
  |---A---B
              feature-x
                |
                C---D (bug fix here)

If you only want commit D:
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <hash-of-D>

✔️ Now main has that fix without merging feature-x.




Cherry-pick Multiple Commits

git cherry-pick a1b2c3 d4e5f6

Or a range:

git cherry-pick a1b2c3..d4e5f6




Conflict Handling

If conflicts occur:

  # fix conflicts manually
  git add .
  git cherry-pick --continue


Cancel cherry-pick:

  git cherry-pick --abort


⚠️ Caution
  Duplicates commit history
  Avoid cherry-picking large features
  Fine for small fixes only










# 🔍 Git Bisect

What is git bisect?
git bisect helps you find the exact commit that introduced a bug using binary search.
👉 Instead of checking 100 commits one by one, Git finds it in ~7 steps.

How Bisect Works
  1.You tell Git:
      One good commit
      One bad commit
  2.Git checks the middle commit
  3.You test it and mark it good/bad
  4.Git repeats until it finds the culprit


Start Bisect
  git bisect start


Mark Bad (Current Commit)
  git bisect bad


Mark Good (Older Commit)
  git bisect good <commit-hash>

Example:
  git bisect good v1.0




Git Auto-checkout

Git will now:
  Checkout a commit
  Ask you to test

After testing:
  git bisect good   # if bug not present
  git bisect bad    # if bug present

Repeat until Git says:
  abc123 is the first bad commit
🎯 Bug found


End Bisect
  git bisect reset


Returns you to original branch.



Automation (Advanced / Production)
  git bisect run npm test


Git automatically:
  Runs tests
  Marks good/bad
  Finds the bug commit



When to Use Bisect

✅ Bug introduced recently
✅ Regression issues
✅ Large commit history
❌ Not useful if bug is non-deterministic



🧠 Cherry-pick vs Merge vs Rebase
| Feature  | Cherry-pick | Merge               | Rebase        |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Commits  | Single      | All                 | All           |
| History  | Duplicate   | Preserved           | Rewritten     |
| Use case | Hotfix      | Feature integration | Clean history |



✅ Production Best Practices

✔ Use cherry-pick for hotfixes only
✔ Use merge for shared branches
✔ Use rebase before pushing personal branches
✔ Use bisect when tests can detect bugs
