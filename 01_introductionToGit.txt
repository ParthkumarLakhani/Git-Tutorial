# What is Git ??
  Git is a Distributed Version Control System (VCS).

  It helps you:
    Track code changes
    Go back to previous versions
    Work with multiple developers safely
    Experiment without breaking production code


  Without Git (problem)
    You edit files → overwrite old code
    No history
    No collaboration safety
    “final_final_v3_really_final.js” 😵

  With Git (solution)
    Every change is tracked
    Every version is saved
    You can undo mistakes
    Teams can work together



# What is gitHub ??
GitHub is a cloud platform that hosts Git repositories. / GitHub = Cloud storage + collaboration for Git repositories


Think like this:
  Git = tool
  GitHub = service/platform


Other Git platforms:
  GitHub (most popular)
  GitLab
  Bitbucket

Why GitHub?
  Remote backup of code
  Collaboration
  Pull Requests (PR)
  Code review
  CI/CD
  Issues, Projects, Wikis
