#Hooks (Automation)
Hooks are scripts that run on Git events (e.g., pre-commit).

Located in .git/hooks/.
Example: pre-commit to run linters.
Production: Use tools like Husky for JS projects.


🪝 Git Hooks (Automation in Git)
What are Git Hooks?

Git Hooks are scripts that automatically run when certain Git events happen.

Example events:
  Before commit
  After commit
  Before push
  After merge

👉 They help enforce rules, run checks, and prevent bad code from entering a repo.


Where Hooks Live
  .git/hooks/

Inside you’ll see:
  pre-commit.sample
  commit-msg.sample
  pre-push.sample

⚠️ These .sample files do nothing until renamed.




How Hooks Work (Simple Flow)

You run: git commit
↓
Git triggers: pre-commit hook
↓
Script runs
↓
✔ success → commit proceeds
❌ failure → commit blocked




Common Hooks You Should Know
| Hook         | When it runs   | Common Use             |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------- |
| `pre-commit` | Before commit  | Linting, formatting    |
| `commit-msg` | Commit message | Enforce commit format  |
| `pre-push`   | Before push    | Run tests              |
| `post-merge` | After merge    | Install deps           |
| `pre-rebase` | Before rebase  | Block dangerous rebase |



⚠️ Important Limitations of Git Hooks

❌ Hooks are NOT version controlled
  .git/hooks is local
  Not shared with team by default

👉 This is why tools exist.



🏭 Production Approach (IMPORTANT)
Why Not Plain Git Hooks?
| Problem        | Reason                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Not shared     | Each dev must set manually |
| Hard to manage | Different OS               |
| Easy to skip   | `--no-verify`              |



✅ Solution: Husky (Most Common)
Husky manages Git hooks inside your repo




Common Production Hooks
| Hook       | Purpose              |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| pre-commit | ESLint, Prettier     |
| commit-msg | Conventional commits |
| pre-push   | Run tests            |
| post-merge | npm install          |



Git Hooks vs CI/CD
| Git Hooks      | CI/CD             |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Local          | Remote            |
| Fast feedback  | Final gate        |
| Can be skipped | Cannot be skipped |



Best Practices 🔥

✔ Keep hooks fast
✔ Use Husky for teams
✔ Don’t block commits with slow tests
✔ Enforce formatting early
✔ Use CI as final authority|




Interview Answer (Short)

“Git hooks are scripts that run automatically on Git events like pre-commit or pre-push, used to enforce code quality. In production, tools like Husky are used to version-control and manage hooks across teams.”
