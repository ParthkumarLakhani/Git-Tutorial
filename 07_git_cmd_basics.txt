# Branches


A branch is just a pointer to a commit. Think of it as:  “A separate line of work”

main → stable production code
feature/* → new features
bugfix/* → fixes



git branch     : Lists local branches, * shows current branch

git branch -a   : Show all branches (local + remote)

Notes
  Does NOT switch branches
  Safe read-only command


git branch <name>    : Creates a new branch, Does NOT switch to it

git checkout <branch> (old way)   : Switches to another branch, Updates working directory

git checkout -b feature/new      : Create + switch

Notes
  Older but still common
  Also used for restoring files (confusing)


git switch <branch> ⭐ Modern & Recommended
What it does
  Switch branches
  Clear intent (only for branches)


git switch -c feature/new             : Create + switch

Notes
  Safer than checkout
  Beginner-friendly
  Introduced to reduce confusion



git branch -d <branch>    : Deletes a local branch, Only if merged

Why Git blocks deletion?
To prevent losing work.

git branch -D old-branch



git merge <branch>   : Merges another branch into current branch
git merge feature/new



git switch main
git merge feature/new


Merge Types

1️⃣ Fast-forward merge ✅
If no new commits on main:
No merge commit created.

2️⃣ Merge commit 🔀
If both branches changed:
merge commit

3️⃣ Merge conflicts ⚠️
Occurs when:  
  Same lines modified in both branches

Git will ask you to:
  Manually resolve
  Add files
  Commit merge



Branch Commands Comparison
| Task                 | Command              |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| List branches        | `git branch`         |
| Create branch        | `git branch name`    |
| Switch branch        | `git switch name`    |
| Create + switch      | `git switch -c name` |
| Delete merged branch | `git branch -d name` |
| Merge branch         | `git merge name`     |



## what is difference between checkout and switch ??

Why are there TWO commands ?
Originally, git checkout did too many things:

Switch branches ❌
Create branches ❌
Restore files ❌

This caused confusion and mistakes.

👉 So Git introduced:

git switch → only for branches
git restore → only for files

Clear intent, fewer accidents ✅



git checkout

What it can do (many things)

git checkout main            # switch branch
git checkout -b feature/new  # create + switch
git checkout -- file.txt     # restore file


Problem ❌   One command doing 3 different jobs.


When people make mistakes
git checkout file.txt

They think they’re switching branch — but they discard changes 😬


Key Differences Table
| Feature            | git checkout | git switch |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| Switch branches    | ✅            | ✅          |
| Create branch      | ✅ (`-b`)     | ✅ (`-c`)   |
| Restore files      | ✅            | ❌          |
| Risk of data loss  | ⚠️ High       | ✅ Low      |
| Beginner friendly  | ❌            | ✅          |
| Modern recommended | ❌            | ✅          |
