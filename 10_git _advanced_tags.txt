# Tags
Tags mark specific commits (e.g., releases)


What is a Tag ?? 🏷️
A tag is a label attached to a specific commit.

Think of it as: “This commit = version 1.0”

Common uses:
  Releases (v1.0.0)
  Hotfix points
  Production deployments


Tag vs Branch (Very Important)

| Branch               | Tag                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Moves forward        | Fixed               |
| Used for development | Used for marking    |
| Can change           | Immutable reference |



1️⃣ git tag <name> — Lightweight Tag

git tag v1.0

What it does
  Creates a lightweight tag
  Points to current commit

Check tags
  git tag

Push tag to remote
  git push origin v1.0


Notes
  No message
  No author/date metadata
  Fast but limited



2️⃣ git tag -a <name> -m "message" ⭐ Annotated Tag (Recommended)

git tag -a v1.0 -m "Release 1.0"

What it does
  Creates an annotated tag
  Stores:
    Tagger name
    Date
    Message


View tag details
git show v1.0

Why annotated tags?
  Better for releases
  Signed possible (-s)
  Industry standard


Push annotated tag
  git push origin v1.0

Or push all tags:
  git push origin --tags



3️⃣ git tag -d <name> — Delete Tag

git tag -d v1.0

What it does
  Deletes local tag only


Delete remote tag
  git push origin --delete v1.0


Notes
  Local and remote tags are independent
  Deleting locally does NOT delete remote



Tag a Past Commit

git tag -a v1.0 abc123 -m "Release 1.0"

Used when:
  Release decided later
  Tagging production commit



Real Company Workflow 🏢
git checkout main
git pull
git tag -a v2.3.0 -m "Release v2.3.0"
git push origin v2.3.0



Semantic Versioning (Very Common)
vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
v2.1.4
| Change          | Version |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Breaking change | MAJOR   |
| New feature     | MINOR   |
| Bug fix         | PATCH   |




Interview One-Liners 💡

Tag = fixed pointer to commit
Lightweight vs Annotated
Annotated preferred for releases
Tags don’t move like branches


Golden Rules 🛑

✔ Use annotated tags for releases
✔ Never retag released versions
✔ Push tags explicitly
✔ Keep tags immutable



in general developer are not used tag, delivery manager or product manager when they have to new release that time they wil used it.
