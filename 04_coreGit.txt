# Core Git Concepts (Beginner Level)


Repository (Repo): A folder tracked by Git, containing files and .git (hidden folder with history).

Working Directory: Your current files.

Staging Area (Index): Files ready to be committed (via git add).

Commit: A snapshot of changes with a message, author, timestamp, and unique SHA-1 hash (e.g., abc123).

Branch: A lightweight pointer to a commit. Default is main (formerly master).

HEAD: Points to the current branch/commit you're on.

Remote: A version of your repo elsewhere (e.g., on GitHub).

Merge: Combine branches.

Conflict: When changes overlap; Git prompts manual resolution.

Tag: A label for a commit (e.g., v1.0 for releases).

Git's model: Changes → Stage → Commit → Push/Pull.



File states
Each file in a working tree can have the following states:

Untracked — a new file was added to the working tree but it's not tracked by Git yet. You can start to track it by using git add command (see below).

Modified — the changes were made in the working tree but not yet staged for commit (in other words, these changes are not added to the current index).

Staged — the changes were added to the index. This way, they will become a part of the next commit.

Commited — the changes were added to the project history as a part of a commit. All commits are stored in the .git folder.
