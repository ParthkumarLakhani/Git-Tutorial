# Rebasing (Alternative to Merge)
Rebasing rewrites history by moving commits onto another base.


What is Rebase ??
Rebasing = moving your commits to a new base commit

In simple words:  “Pretend my work was done on top of the latest code.”

⚠️ Rebase rewrites commit history.



Merge vs Rebase (Big Picture)

Merge (safe, keeps history)
main ──●──●─────●
        \        /
         feature─●
Creates a merge commit.


Rebase (clean, linear)
main ──●──●──●──●
                ↑
            feature commits replayed
No merge commit.




1️⃣ git rebase <base>
git rebase main

What it does
  Takes commits from current branch
  Replays them on top of main


Example workflow
git switch feature/login
git rebase main

Before:
main:     A──B
feature:     └──C──D

After:
main:     A──B
feature:         └──C'──D'
(C' and D' are new commits)

Notes ⚠️

Commit IDs change
History rewritten
Avoid on shared branches




2️⃣ Conflict during rebase

If conflict happens:

# fix conflicts
git add <file>
git rebase --continue


Abort if needed:

git rebase --abort





3️⃣ git rebase -i HEAD~n ⭐ Interactive Rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3

What it does
  Opens editor
  Lets you edit history

Example screen
pick a1 Fix typo
pick b2 Add validation
pick c3 Debug logs


Common actions
| Action         | Meaning               |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| `pick`         | keep commit           |
| `s` / `squash` | merge with previous   |
| `reword`       | change commit message |
| `edit`         | modify commit         |
| `drop`         | delete commit         |



Squash example

Before:

pick a1 Fix typo
pick b2 Add validation
pick c3 Debug logs


Change to:

pick a1 Fix typo
s b2 Add validation
s c3 Debug logs


Result:
➡️ One clean commit





When should you use Rebase? ✅

✔ Cleaning local commits
✔ Updating feature branch with main
✔ Before opening a PR
✔ Solo development


When should you NOT use Rebase? ❌

❌ On shared branches
❌ On pushed commits others depend on
❌ On main / develop (usually)



Rebase vs Merge — Quick Table
| Feature        | Merge     | Rebase    |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| History        | Preserved | Rewritten |
| Merge commit   | Yes       | No        |
| Safe for teams | Yes       | No        |
| Clean history  | Medium    | Excellent |
| Risk           | Low       | High      |




Interview One-Liner 💡

Rebase rewrites history by replaying commits on a new base, while merge preserves history with a merge commit.


Memory Trick 

Merge = record history
Rebase = rewrite history


Pro Tip: Merge for shared work (preserves history); Rebase for local cleanup.
