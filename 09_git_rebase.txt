# Rebasing (Alternative to Merge)
Rebasing rewrites history by moving commits onto another base.


What is Rebase ??
Rebasing = moving your commits to a new base commit

In simple words:  “Pretend my work was done on top of the latest code.”

⚠️ Rebase rewrites commit history.



Merge vs Rebase (Big Picture)

Merge (safe, keeps history)
main ──●──●─────●
        \        /
         feature─●
Creates a merge commit.


Rebase (clean, linear)
main ──●──●──●──●
                ↑
            feature commits replayed
No merge commit.




1️⃣ git rebase <base>
git rebase main

What it does
  Takes commits from current branch
  Replays them on top of main


Example workflow
git switch feature/login
git rebase main

Before:
main:     A──B
feature:     └──C──D

After:
main:     A──B
feature:         └──C'──D'
(C' and D' are new commits)

Notes ⚠️

Commit IDs change
History rewritten
Avoid on shared branches




2️⃣ Conflict during rebase

If conflict happens:

# fix conflicts
git add <file>
git rebase --continue


Abort if needed:

git rebase --abort





3️⃣ git rebase -i HEAD~n ⭐ Interactive Rebase
git rebase -i HEAD~3

What it does
  Opens editor
  Lets you edit history

Example screen
pick a1 Fix typo
pick b2 Add validation
pick c3 Debug logs


Common actions
| Action         | Meaning               |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| `pick`         | keep commit           |
| `s` / `squash` | merge with previous   |
| `reword`       | change commit message |
| `edit`         | modify commit         |
| `drop`         | delete commit         |



Squash example

Before:

pick a1 Fix typo
pick b2 Add validation
pick c3 Debug logs


Change to:

pick a1 Fix typo
s b2 Add validation
s c3 Debug logs


Result:
➡️ One clean commit





When should you use Rebase? ✅

✔ Cleaning local commits
✔ Updating feature branch with main
✔ Before opening a PR
✔ Solo development


When should you NOT use Rebase? ❌

❌ On shared branches
❌ On pushed commits others depend on
❌ On main / develop (usually)



Rebase vs Merge — Quick Table
| Feature        | Merge     | Rebase    |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| History        | Preserved | Rewritten |
| Merge commit   | Yes       | No        |
| Safe for teams | Yes       | No        |
| Clean history  | Medium    | Excellent |
| Risk           | Low       | High      |




Interview One-Liner 💡

Rebase rewrites history by replaying commits on a new base, while merge preserves history with a merge commit.


Memory Trick 

Merge = record history
Rebase = rewrite history


Pro Tip: Merge for shared work (preserves history); Rebase for local cleanup.

Most of the time we never used rebase in main or master branch.

Ensure you are on the branch you want to rebase





what is difference between pull, fetch and rebase ??

These are common Git commands for managing changes between local and remote repositories. I'll explain each one, their purposes, and key differences. Note that pull and fetch are primarily for syncing with remotes, while rebase is a way to integrate changes (often used in conjunction with them).



Fetch

Command: git fetch <remote>
What it does: Downloads the latest commits, branches, and tags from a remote repository (e.g., origin) to your local repository, but does not merge them into your current branch. It updates your local references (like origin/main) without affecting your working files or current branch.
Key behavior: Safe and non-destructive; it's essentially a "preview" of remote changes. You can inspect differences (e.g., via git log origin/main) before deciding to merge or rebase.
When to use: When you want to see what's new on the remote without committing to changes in your local work. Common in team workflows to check for updates.



Pull

Command: git pull <remote> <branch>
What it does: A combination of git fetch followed by git merge. It fetches remote changes and automatically merges them into your current branch.
Key behavior: Can create merge commits if there are diverging changes, which preserves history but might clutter the commit graph with extra "merge" entries. If conflicts arise, you'll need to resolve them manually.
When to use: For quick updates when you're okay with merge commits and want to integrate remote changes immediately. Default behavior in many workflows, but can lead to a non-linear history.



Rebase

Command: git rebase <base> (often used as git rebase <remote>/<branch> after fetching)
What it does: Moves your local commits to a new base commit, effectively "replaying" them on top of the updated branch (e.g., after fetching remote changes). This creates a linear history without merge commits.
Key behavior: Rewrites commit history, which can make it cleaner but is dangerous if you've already pushed those commits (it can cause issues for collaborators). Never rebase shared branches. Often paired with fetch/pull for cleaner integration.
When to use: To maintain a clean, linear commit history (e.g., before merging a feature branch). Use git pull --rebase to fetch and rebase in one step instead of merging.
