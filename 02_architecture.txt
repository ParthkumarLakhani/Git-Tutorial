# Architecture

Three main areas
  Working Directory → Staging Area → Repository



1. Working Directory

  Your actual project files
  Where you write code


2. Staging Area (Index)

  Files ready to be committed
  Like a “review before save”


3. Repository (.git)

  Permanent history
  Each commit stored here
