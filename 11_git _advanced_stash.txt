# Stashing (Temporary Storage)

What is git stash ??
git stash temporarily saves your local changes and gives you a clean working directory.

Think of it as: “Put my unfinished work in a drawer, I’ll come back later.”


What does stash save ?
By default:

✅ Tracked file changes
❌ Untracked files
❌ Ignored files

(To include untracked: git stash -u)




1️⃣ git stash

What it does
  Saves unstaged & staged changes
  Resets working directory to last commit


Example
# you edited some files
git status

modified: app.js
modified: config.js

Save work:
git stash

Now:
git status

working tree clean


Notes
  Creates a stash entry
  Does NOT commit
  Changes are safe



2️⃣ git stash list

What it does
  Shows all saved stashes

stash@{0}: WIP on main: 3a1f9 Fix login
stash@{1}: WIP on feature/cart


Notes
  stash@{0} is the most recent




3️⃣ git stash apply

What it does
  Restores latest stash
  Keeps stash in list


Apply specific stash
  git stash apply stash@{1}

Restore staged files too
  git stash apply --index

Notes
  Can cause conflicts
  Safe (stash remains)



4️⃣ git stash pop
What it does
  Applies stash
  Deletes it from stash list


Difference: apply vs pop
| Command | Applies | Removes stash |
| ------- | ------- | ------------- |
| apply   | ✅      | ❌             |
| pop     | ✅      | ✅             |


5️⃣ git stash drop

git stash drop stash@{0}

What it does
  Deletes a stash entry
  Does NOT apply it


Delete all stashes
  git stash clear
⚠️ Dangerous – cannot recover easily
